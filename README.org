You might ask why the heck someone would like to use Emacs inside a
container. The thing is, I wanted a /kind of/ isolated environment to
not pollute my desktop.

I know that softwares like *distrobox* and *toolbox* exists, but I
wanted a simple solution.

** How do I use this?
Really simple, just run the ~build.sh~ script: ~$ ./build.sh~

Next, you need to tweak your shell:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  emacs() {
      podman volume create --ignore emacs-data

      podman run -dt --rm \
  	   --name=emacs \
  	   --network=host \
  	   -v $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/$WAYLAND_DISPLAY:/tmp/$WAYLAND_DISPLAY \
  	   -v emacs-data:/root/.config/emacs \
  	   # Bind ssh keys for git authentication
  	   -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh:z \
  	   # If you don't use Org, you might want to comment this line
  	   -v $HOME/$YOUR_ORG_DIRECTORY:/root/Org:z \
  	   -v $HOME:/workdir:z \
  	   emacs
      
  }
#+END_SRC

Copy and paste that into your ~.bashrc~ or ~.zshrc~ and it's done.
