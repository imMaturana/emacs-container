You might ask why the heck someone would like to use Emacs inside a
container. The thing is, I wanted a /kind of/ isolated environment to
not pollute my desktop.

I know that softwares like *distrobox* and *toolbox* exists, but I
wanted a simple solution.

** How do I use this?
Really simple, just run the ~build.sh~ script: ~$ ./build.sh~

Next, you need to tweak your shell:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  emacs() {
      if ! podman container exists emacs; then
  	podman create \
  	       --name=emacs \
  	       --network=host \
  	       -v $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/$WAYLAND_DISPLAY:/tmp/$WAYLAND_DISPLAY \
  	       # Bind ssh keys for git authentication
  	       -v $HOME/.ssh:/root/.ssh:ro \
  	       -v $HOME/YOUR_ORG_DIRECTORY:/root/Org:z \
  	       -v $HOME/YOUR_ORG_ROAM_DIRECTORY:/root/Roam:z \
  	       -v $HOME/YOUR_PROJECTS_DIRECOTYR:/root/Projects:z \
  	       emacs
      fi

      podman start emacs
  }
#+END_SRC

Copy and paste this into your ~.bashrc~ or ~.zshrc~ and it's done.
